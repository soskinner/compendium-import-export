Metallic Arts
Feruchemical Gold: In Feruchemy, health is stored in gold. A goldmind can be tapped to heal at an accelerated rate, or to heal from wounds that would normally be fatal.[67] It's hard to fill a goldmind, due to the fact that it requires the Bloodmaker to spend time sickly and weak. Gold does not heal diseases as efficiently as it heals wounds, but it can heal damage to the soul.[149][123] A gold Compounder can use gold to have a nearly infinite supply of health. When Compounding, a Bloodmaker can heal very rapidly, and can survive flaying, decapitations, and point-blank explosions.[150][151] The recovery from injuries and wounds is almost instantaneous.[116]
Allomantic Aluminum: In Allomancy, burning aluminum would be able to heal the withering inflicted by a Shade.[152] If someone were able to burn the amount of aluminum needed to become an Allomantic savant with the metal, it may be possible to cleanse their spirit of unwanted effects of Investiture.[153]
Allomantic Pewter: In Allomancy, burning pewter grants the user the ability to heal from otherwise deadly wounds, and to recover much more quickly.[154]
The Dor
AonDor: In AonDor, the Aon Ien is used as the basis for healing.[155] To maximize its potential, Elantrians use specialized modifiers that can target the part of the body that needs to be healed, as well as define how the healing should take place.[156]
Elantrians: Elantrians are able to heal themselves quickly and survive fatal injuries, such as decapitation.[157] This ability doesn't function if the massive Aon Rao of Elantris is non-functional. Reod Elantrians' wounds will refuse to heal; nonetheless, a Reod Elantrian can only be killed by decapitation or burning, while remaining immune to hunger or most fatal wounds, as the Dor keeps their bodies functioning.[158]
Forgery: A form of Forgery practiced by surgeons is called Resealing.[159] Resealing can effect miraculous healing, even allowing to survive otherwise fatal wounds, but it doesn't repair spiritual damage. Forgery can also be used to Forge a new soul.[160]
Rosharan system
Surgebinding: With Stormlight as a fuel source, Surgebinders are able to heal both their body and their soul. Almost any kind of injury can be reversed, including bad eyesight, scar tissues, or Spiritual damage done by a Shardblade.[161]
Progression Surge: In Surgebinding, the Progression Surge can alter the growth and healing of organisms.[162] Using Growth and Regrowth, the Surgebinder can heal the damage done to the body and the soul of other people near-instantly.[106][163] Thanks to this, Surgebinders with Progression are nigh-on unkillable so long as they have Stormlight.[164]
Surge Fabrial: A Surge Fabrial is able to mimic the Radiant ability of Regrowth. Ancient Radiants possessed fabrials constructed from a large topaz and a heliodor that were able to "regrow" and repair injuries through manipulating the Surge of Progression.[165] In the present day, most of those fabrials, as well as the knowledge of how to make them, have been lost; however, the Herald Nale possesses one capable of bringing someone back from the brink of death.[166]
Honorblade: An Honorblade inherently grants the ability to Surgebind.[167][168] This allows the user to heal with Stormlight, but doesn't let them heal from a soul wound.[49]
Regal: There is a Regal form that grants healing.[169]
Fused: The Fused use Voidlight to heal themselves.[170] Precisely how they do that, and whether their ability has any similarity to Radiants', is uncertain.[171][140]
